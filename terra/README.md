# Terra Worldgen Notes

This folder is a placeholder for Terra configuration files.

Terra does not "spit out" a world file you can preview directly. It generates terrain when the server creates a world using the Terra generator.

Typical flow:
1) Install Terra on your server.
2) Create or edit a Terra pack (YAML/JSON configs).
3) Set the world generator to Terra.
4) Start the server to generate the world.
5) (Optional) Pre-generate chunks and export a world download for preview.

If you want, tell me your desired island size, region layout, and biomes, and I can draft the Terra config files here.
